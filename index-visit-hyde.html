    <h3>Directions to Hyde Observatory</h3>
		<p>Hyde Memorial Observatory is located on the south side of Holmes Lake in Southeast Lincoln Nebraska. From downtown take Normal Boulevard all the way to South 70th Street, then turn south (right) and continue (past the North Shore Road entrance) to the South Shore Road entrance to Holmes Park. This is the same entrance used to get to the golf course. Turn west (right) onto the South Shore Road and continue (past the golf course turnoff) until you see the observatory on your left. (Additional information can be obtained by calling the Lincoln Parks and Recreation Dept. at 441-8708)</p>
        <h4>Please Note</h4>
		<p>The South Shore of Holmes Lake normally closes at 6 pm; however it will be kept open on those nights when Hyde Observatory is open, for Hyde Observatory patrons only. For the Current Programs and Schedule: Call (402) 441-7094 FREE! NO ADMISSION CHARGED!</p>
        <h4>Special Arrangements</h4>
		<p>Special arrangements can be made for groups of 20 or more (clubs, church groups, classes or even just a group of friends) on nights other than the regularly scheduled Saturday nights. Here is how Hyde can help:
